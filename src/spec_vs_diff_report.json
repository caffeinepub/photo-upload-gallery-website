  "summary": "The diff implements a warm autumn-sunset palette across global CSS and multiple UI surfaces, and updates the hero section with warm gradient overlays and maintains smooth-scroll CTAs. However, the requested hero background image edit (autumn sunset with subtle falling leaves motif and warm grain) is not evidenced in the diff summary, and several non-requested functional enhancements appear to have been added to upload/gallery/viewer components.",

      "requirement": "Update the homepage visual theme to evoke “falling autumn leaves, sunset time” (including the falling leaves motif) across the landing header, hero, highlights, upload, gallery, dialogs, and footer while keeping all existing functionality unchanged.",
      "reason": "While the warm sunset palette and styling updates are evident, the 'falling autumn leaves' motif itself is not clearly implemented anywhere in the code changes shown (no leaf overlay/animation/styling hook is visible). It may have been intended via the hero image edit, but that asset change is not evidenced in this diff summary.",

      "reason": "The hero continues to reference the same asset path, but the diff summary does not show any change to the actual image file under frontend/public/assets/generated, so the requested image conversion (autumn sunset + falling leaves + grain) is not verifiable from the provided diff summary.",
