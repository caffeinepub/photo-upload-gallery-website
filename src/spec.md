## Summary
**Goal:** Update the homepage look and feel to a warm “falling autumn leaves at sunset” theme while keeping all existing landing page functionality unchanged.

**Planned changes:**
- Shift the homepage color system to a cohesive warm autumn sunset palette (amber/orange/copper/burgundy) across header, hero, highlights, upload, gallery, dialogs, and footer in both light and dark mode.
- Update surfaces, borders, accents, and hover/focus states to match the new theme while maintaining accessible contrast.
- Restyle the hero section overlays/gradients and text emphasis colors to feel like a warm sunset scene with drifting leaves, without altering CTA behavior or page structure.

**User-visible outcome:** The landing page presents a consistent autumn-sunset theme (including an updated hero look) while navigation, smooth-scroll CTAs, upload flow, gallery, and photo viewer dialog continue to work as they do today.
